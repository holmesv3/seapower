# Seapower II
[![Vercel App](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/vercel?icon=vercel&label)](https://seapower.vercel.app)

This project is the result of me getting [nerd sniped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd_sniping)
by a friend of mine, and wanting an excuse to learn a javascript framework. 

If you look through the code and think that it's terrible, that's because it probably is. 

# Running the app

This is not guaranteed to be fully functional - in fact, quite the opposite is true!

The app is built using Svelte, and can be deployed as a web app (see the [Vercel App](https://seapower.vercel.app/) above), or if you pull the source code, you can use Tauri 
to build for local use.

If building from source, simply use 
```sh
npm run dev
```
Or, if building with Tauri,
```sh
npm run tauri dev
```
