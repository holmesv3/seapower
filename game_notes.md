# Basic outline
1. Decide situation
   - Date of action
   - Place of action
   - Objectives
   - What ships
   - Initial conditions
2. Decide distance (scale)
3. Fill in values on Naval Engagement Record Sheets
4. Move ships
5. Commence action simultaneously. Roll dice seperately for each:
   - Main battery
   - Secondary battery
   - torpedo
   - aircraft
   - depth charge
6. Compute hits
7. Compute damage percentage
8. Compute los of individual ship's capabilities on the basis of cumulative  damage percentage
9. Record results on Naval Engagement Record Sheets
10. Repeat (4)-(9) until one side achieves objective, or one side is destroyed completely

# Ship movement
1. Sides move ships alternating who goes first
2. All moves are based on a theoretical five minute period. The distance a ship can move is based on how far it can go in five minutes at a given speed up to its maximum speed (either  original or reduced by damage)
3. Distance scales are:
    | Scale | 2k yd / 12 knots / 1nmi |
    | --- | --- |
    | Standard | 2 inches | 
    | Large | 4 inches | 
    | Extra Large | 8 inches |
